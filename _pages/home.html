        <h2>About KatieConf</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>KatieConf is a parody. Have you checked a calendar lately? There is no <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=November%2031st">November 31st</a>. Sorry. The town of Katy, TX <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy,_Texas">does exist</a>, though.</p>
        <p>However, all the people featured in the KatieConf lineup <a href="https://twitter.com/glasnt/status/728420940292313089">are real</a>. There are so many fantastic technical presenters who <a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/728423233146355712">just happened to be called Katie</a>, or a variation thereupon. All the organisers listed have put in countless hours into organising and running usergroups, conferences, meetups, podcasts and more.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for speakers for your conference, why not ask one of the wonderful people featured here? They are all listed with a social media accounts, and a link to some of their prior talks.</p>
        <p>Do you really need another conference lineup of all men? Or as many female speakers as speakers called Dave?</p>
        <p>The tagline of this year's conference is in reference to the book of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Abundance_of_Katherines">same name</a>, and is in no way an endorsement by the author of the conference. It's just a pretty good pun. (DFTBA ðŸ––)
